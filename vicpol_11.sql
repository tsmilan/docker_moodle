This method will not\nreturn any information about the enrolments in courses that are not available for\nremote enrolment, even if their users are enrolled into them via other plugin\n(note the difference from {@link self::user_enrolments()}).\nThis method will return enrolment information for users from hosts regardless\nthe enrolment plugin. It does not matter if the user was enrolled remotely by\ntheir admin or locally. Once the course is available for remote enrolments, we\nwill tell them everything about their users.\nIn Moodle 1.x the returned array used to be indexed by username. The side effect\nof MDL-19219 fix is that we do not need to use such index and therefore we can\nreturn all enrolment records. MNet clients 1.x will only use the last record for\nthe student, if she is enrolled via multiple plugins.	a:2:{s:10:"parameters";a:2:{i:0;a:3:{s:4:"name";s:8:"courseid";s:4:"type";s:3:"int";s:11:"description";s:16:"ID of our course";}i:1;a:3:{s:4:"name";s:5:"roles";s:4:"type";s:12:"string|array";s:11:"description";s:58:"comma separated list of role shortnames (or array of them)";}}s:6:"return";a:2:{s:4:"type";s:5:"array";s:11:"description";s:0:"";}}	enrol.php	enrol_mnet_mnetservice_enrol	0

1	0	0	Separate and Connected ways of knowing	Mostly separate knowing,Separate and connected,Mostly connected knowing	The scale based on the theory of separate and connected knowing. This theory describes two different ways that we can evaluate and learn about the things we see and hear.<ul><li><strong>Separate knowers</strong> remain as objective as possible without including feelings and emotions. In a discussion with other people, they like to defend their own ideas, using logic to find holes in opponent's ideas.</li><li><strong>Connected knowers</strong> are more sensitive to other people. They are skilled at empathy and tends to listen and ask questions until they feel they can connect and "understand things from their point of view". They learn by trying to share the experiences that led to the knowledge they find in other people.</li></ul>	0	1526278569
